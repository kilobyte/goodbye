Description: next part after 'hello', and a packaging example
 This is the much needed step after the traditional 'Hello world.'.
 .
 In fact, though, it is an example for Debian developers: a showcase of
 efficient packaging techniques.  It doesnâ€™t require slow debhelper or even
 dpkg-dev, but uses a JIT compiler for speed.
 .
 (In case this is not obvious: this is a joke, but not devoid of educational
 value: it showcases inner workings of the .deb package format.  You are NOT
 supposed to follow the techniques used here, though.)
